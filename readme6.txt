This is not a tutorials. There are my codes created for the request below:

Palindrome Testing – a palindrome is a word or phrase that spells the same thing forward or backwards. “civic” is a palindrome. Users will be allowed to enter a single word to test – no spaces allowed.

Write a script that will test if the word entered is a palindrome. You are NOT allowed to use the JavaScript reverse() method.

Your JavaScript is to be placed in an external file and use at least one callback function for other than the initial windows.onload event.

User entry is to be limited to 10 characters maximum, tested and controlled only through JavaScript. Do NOT limit the entry length via form field attributes.  Inform the user if their entry is too short or too long. Input length validation is to be its own function that returns a true or false.

Inform the user if their input is valid and if it is a palindrome or not.
